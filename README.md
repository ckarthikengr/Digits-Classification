# Digits-Classification
1) Project Overview

      This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits using various machine learning models and analyzing their accuracy.
        Following models are used 
          K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
          Random Forest
          Support Vector Machine (SVM)
          Naive Bayes

2) Steps to Run the Code
   
      Run python file ending with .py to execute the code.

3) Results and Observations

     The models were tested on the same dataset, and their accuracy was printed.
     Among all, the Support Vector Machine with Polynomial Kernel (SVM-Poly) achieved the highest accuracy
   
     The results are as follows:


                Model	    VS                   Accuracy in percentage
   
        Support Vector Machine - Poly	              99.17

        Support Vector Machine -RBF	                98.61

        K-NN	                                      98.33

        Support Vector Machine - Linear	            97.78

        Random Forest	                              97.22

        Support Vector Machine - Sigmoid	          90

        Na√Øve Bayes	                                84.72
